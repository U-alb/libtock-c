# Temperature Sensor App

For now, let's just implement this app as a simple temperature sensor
that reads the temperature and displays the temperature on the screen

Todos:
- [ ] configure temp sensor/get temperature reading 
- [ ] display temperature on half the screen

We need to decide if we want to use the graph brad implemented? I'm skeptical of
how good this will look on half a screen.
